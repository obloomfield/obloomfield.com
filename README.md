[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/014e14da-8524-466c-bace-6b3653807a64/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/obloomfield/deploys)

Hello there! This is the current iteration of my portfolio site, where I will be hosting resume and project information, as well as information on the puzzle content that I am currently working on. I made it using Next.js with a really nice styling package (chakra ui), and the 3D visual in the header is with Three.js.

## Setup and Fair Use

If you are interested, feel free to modify this portfolio site to fit your needs!

First, make sure you have node and npm up to date by installing them on their sites and build tools, then type:

``npm i`` to install all dependencies, and 
``npm run build`` to make a new local build, and
``npm run dev`` to start the dev localhost!
